// 1. Write a method that will take an array player scores for a series of games

// Test your solution:

// 2. Corner cases
// Think about corner cases. We give one in the tests below when
// the players are tied. Can you think of other corner cases?
// Write at least 2 more tests for corner cases and make sure your
// implementation passes those tests.
